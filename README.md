A React.js app which displays movies and their ratings. 

This is the app with which I've learnt React.js

----------------------React.js Notes-------------------------------------
In React, there are two types of components
->Functional
->Class-based (no longer used)

import React,{ Component } from 'react';
const Example = () => {
    return <div>Hello World!<div>   //  this is JSX
}

JSX is used in React to describe what the UI should look like. 
It comes with full power of Javascript and forms the core of the React app.
